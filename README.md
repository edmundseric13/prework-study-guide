# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This is a prework guide for anyone who is doing the prework for the coding bootcamp. I built this guide to help get a basic understanding of certain topics that are going to be covered in the bootcamp. Although some of the material was hard to understand, it was a very good place to start in ensuring that I was as fully prepared as possible for Day 1 of bootcamp.

## Usage

This prework guide covered certain topics such as: HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Git. When you open the prework guide it shows notes on each of these sections to show things that I learned while completing this project. Another thing to note is that if you open the DevTools console inside of this page, we can see JavaScript running which will include all of the topics that we learned as well as randomly select a topic for us to study first.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
